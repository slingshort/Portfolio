# Portfolio

The purpose of this project was to design and interactive website that allows viewers to engage with me and my work.

Things that I learnt to use during this project:
- effectively use pseudo-classes to make a page more dynamic and interactive
- how to better organise HTML and CSS sheets semantically, as well as comprehensively comment the code
- how to use new attributes such as ":mailto" and "target" to open pop-ups with links.
